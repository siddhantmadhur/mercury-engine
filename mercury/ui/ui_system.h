/**
 * UI System is a retained-mode ui library that is renderer-agnostic. It is
 * independent of PObject implementation and uses its own shader files so it
 * doesn't have any dependencies.
 *
 * Again, since it's retained, it should not be used like imgui where it is
 * called every frame. Rather, creating an element once will keep it existing on
 * the system until it is closed
 *
 * Another important not is that it does not by itself handle creating new
 * objects, or anything on the tree. Instead, it returns a pointer to the top
 * root of the system, and using it you can draw the layout you want.
